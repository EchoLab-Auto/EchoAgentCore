//! The chat-platform capability seam — platform-agnostic message/target
//! types and the `ChatAdapter` Service Definition.
//!
//! A platform (QQ, Telegram, ...) is a `ChatAdapter` provider: it translates
//! platform-specific events into [`IncomingMessage`] values and accepts
//! [`MessageTarget`] values to send replies. Consumers (the agent loop, the
//! generic send/list tools) depend only on this crate — never on a concrete
//! platform crate.
